## 旷视人脸，人头,人脸，身体库

[CrowdHuman](https://www.crowdhuman.org) is a benchmark dataset to better evaluate detectors in crowd scenarios. The CrowdHuman dataset is large, rich-annotated and contains high diversity. CrowdHuman contains 15000, 4370 and 5000 images for training, validation, and testing, respectively. There are a total of 470K human instances from train and validation subsets and 23 persons per image, with various kinds of occlusions in the dataset. Each human instance is annotated with a head bounding-box, human visible-region bounding-box and human full-body bounding-box. We hope our dataset will serve as a solid baseline and help promote future research in human detection tasks.

## WIDER FACE人脸数据库

[WIDER FACE](http://shuoyang1213.me/WIDERFACE/) dataset is a face detection benchmark dataset, of which images are selected from the publicly available WIDER dataset. We choose 32,203 images and label 393,703 faces with a high degree of variability in scale, pose and occlusion as depicted in the sample images. WIDER FACE dataset is organized based on 61 event classes. For each event class, we randomly select 40%/10%/50% data as training, validation and testing sets. We adopt the same evaluation metric employed in the PASCAL VOC dataset. Similar to MALF and Caltech datasets, we do not release bounding box ground truth for the test images. Users are required to submit final prediction files, which we shall proceed to evaluate.
